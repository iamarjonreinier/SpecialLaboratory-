      Hi Ma'am Roan,<br><br>
      First and foremost, thank you, ma’am, for the invaluable knowledge and guidance you have shared with us. Your dedication has not only enriched our learning but also helped shape us into better individuals. We are deeply grateful for your endless patience and understanding, especially during moments when we were noisy or a bit too playful. Your kindness and commitment have made a lasting impact on us.

Once again, thank you for everything, and we wish you a joyful and blessed Christmas!🎄❄️⭐
    </p><br>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Jerome Pili</p>
